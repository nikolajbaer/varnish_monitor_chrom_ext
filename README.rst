Varnish Monitor
===============

*Work in Progress*

Goal:
Google Chrome Extension that monitors the requests on a page and notifies if there are Varnish "Age" cache headers.

(actual age headers are customize-able)

Great if you want to observe un-cached requests without worrying about the Heisenberg uncertainty issue of hitting the page and forgetting to have the Network tab enabled to track the request, then having to wait until it uncaches again.
